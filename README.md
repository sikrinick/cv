## Requirements:
- [Latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)  
You probably have it already installed on your computer, because it is part of MacTeX and MikTeX and is bundled with many Linux Distributions.
For macOS with brew I suggest 
```
brew install --cask mactex
```
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
Required to run build.py script

## Compilation
```zsh
latexmk -xelatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error -outdir=output/pdf "resume.tex"
```

## Editor
As an editor I strongly suggest Visual Studio Code.  
List of required extensions are in `.vscode/extensions.json`.


## Spell checker
I used `aspell` for spell checks in terminal.
```zsh
# install aspell
brew install aspell 

# run spellcheck script
./spellcheck.py
```

### LaTeX
LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.

### Awesome CV
[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.
